Since it is the same diameter as the SDSS telescope (at least for the purposes of Astro 260 homework), the source and background count rates are the same. If you used the APF in scenarios 1 and 2 instead of the SDSS telescope, how would you expect the signal to noise to change? You donâ€™t have to compute the signal to noise for this case, but you must justify your answer.\n",
